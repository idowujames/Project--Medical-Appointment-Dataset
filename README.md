## **Questions for Analysis**


*1) How much does age play in whether a person will show up for their appointment**


> ***Rational:*** Younger people tend to prioritize other things over their health. I will try to findout if younger people who are above the age of parental guidance have a higher percentage of missing appointments than other age groups

*2) How much does the time difference between the date appointment was made and the actual date of the appointment play in whether a person will show up for their appointment**


> ***Rational:*** According to the behavioural sciences, the time intervel between intention and behaviour plays a significant role in behaviour. I intend to find out whether the longer between the day the appointment was made and the actual appointment date makes any significant difference in the patient's showing up. 
I will also investigate if this time interval of no show is affected by the patient's age.
